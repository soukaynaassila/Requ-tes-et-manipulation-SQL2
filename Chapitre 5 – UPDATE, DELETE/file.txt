===> Step 0: What are UPDATE and DELETE?
UPDATE is used to modify existing data in a table.
DELETE is used to remove data from a table.

 --- Both commands are dangerous without WHERE.

===> Step 1: UPDATE – Basic syntax
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;
Explanation:
UPDATE table_name → choose the table
SET → new values
WHERE → select which rows to change

===> Step 2: Update one record
Example:
UPDATE Utilisateur
SET nom = 'Alice Dupont', email = 'alice.dupont@test.com'
WHERE id = 1;
-----> Only the user with id = 1 is updated

===> Step 3: Update multiple records
Example:
UPDATE Article
SET titre = 'Updated Article'
WHERE id_utilisateur = 1;
----->All articles written by user 1 are updated

=====> Step 4: DELETE – Basic syntax
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
------>Without WHERE → all data is deleted

====> Step 5: Delete one record
Example:
DELETE FROM Commentaire
WHERE id = 2;
-----> Only the comment with id = 2 is deleted

====> Step 6: Delete multiple records
Example:
DELETE FROM Article
WHERE date_pub < '2024-01-01';
---->All old articles are removed

===> Step 7: Always verify before and after
Before:
SELECT * FROM Article WHERE date_pub < '2024-01-01';

After:
SELECT * FROM Article;

-----> This avoids mistakes
 Summary (Key Points)

UPDATE modifies existing records
DELETE removes records from a table
WHERE is mandatory to avoid affecting all rows
Test with SELECT before UPDATE or DELETE
Backup data before large deletions
