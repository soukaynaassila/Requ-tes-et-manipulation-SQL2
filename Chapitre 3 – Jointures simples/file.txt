 ==>What is a JOIN?
A JOIN is used to retrieve data from two or more tables that are related by a primary key and a foreign key.

Example:
One table stores employees
Another table stores departments
A JOIN links them together

 -Why do we need JOINs?
Because data is stored in separate tables to avoid duplication.
JOINs allow us to combine this data in one result.

 => Main Types of Joins
1️⃣ INNER JOIN (Most Important)
Returns only rows that exist in both tables
If there is no match, the row is not shown
EX:
SELECT e.nom, d.nom
FROM Employee e
INNER JOIN Department d
ON e.id_department = d.id;

--> Shows employees only if they belong to a department

2️⃣ LEFT JOIN
Returns all rows from the left table
Shows NULL if there is no matching row in the right table
SELECT e.nom, p.nom
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Project p
ON e.id = p.id_employee;

--> Shows all employees, even those without a project

3️⃣ RIGHT JOIN (less used)
Returns all rows from the right table
Similar to LEFT JOIN but reversed
 ==== Aliases (Very Important)
Aliases make queries shorter and clearer

Employee e
Department d
Project p

==== JOIN Condition (ON)
The ON clause defines how tables are linked
ON e.id_department = d.id
This connects:
foreign key → primary key
