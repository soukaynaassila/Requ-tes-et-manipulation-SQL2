=> SELECT
The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a table.
Example:
SELECT * FROM Employee;
➡️ Retrieves all columns and all rows from the Employee table.

🔹 Selecting specific columns
You can choose only the columns you need.
Example:
SELECT nom, prenom FROM Employee;
➡️ Retrieves only the employee names and surnames.

=> WHERE (Filtering data)
The WHERE clause filters records based on a condition.

Example:
SELECT nom, salaire
FROM Employee
WHERE salaire > 4000;
➡️ Retrieves employees with a salary greater than 4000.

🔹 Comparison operators
SQL uses operators to define conditions.

Example with LIKE:
SELECT nom
FROM Employee
WHERE nom LIKE 'S%';
➡️ Retrieves employees whose name starts with the letter S.

=> ORDER BY (Sorting results)
The ORDER BY clause sorts the results.

Example:
SELECT nom, salaire
FROM Employee
ORDER BY salaire DESC(تنازلي);              /*ASC:تصاعدي*/
➡️ Retrieves employees sorted by salary from highest to lowest.

   ->LIMIT (Restricting results)
The LIMIT clause restricts the number of rows returned.

Example:
SELECT nom
FROM Employee
ORDER BY salaire DESC
LIMIT 3;
➡️ Retrieves the top 3 highest-paid employees.
